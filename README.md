# Sowing-Seeds-of-STEM-thru-TechnoFashion
Presentation at CodeMash2017 - Sowing Seeds of STEM through Technofashion.  

Technology is both a rising force in our everyday lives, and one of the fastest growing job sectors. How can we get more young people engaged in the field while making sure that companies have a diverse workforce? To answer that question various partners in Central Ohio came together to offer an immersive experience in techno-fashion, for girls. The highly desired and attended event offered stations exploring techno-fashion topics such as data analytics, prototyping, patterns, electronic hardware and coding. Tony Wagner stated in his book Creating Innovators that a pattern of “play to passion to purpose” will encourage innovative thinking by nurturing curiosity and inquisitiveness of young people. In order to attract and grow more women in technology we must create supportive environments that sparks a passion. Participants of this talk will learn about how to empower more girls into technology as well as gain insight on how to run a similar event in their area.
